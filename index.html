          <h2>So who is <i>James</i>?</h2>
          <img src="Insignia ver. Circle.png" width="150px">
          <p>James is currently a Year 2 student at Singapore Polytechnic (SP) studying Aeronautical Engineering. But before coming to SP, he was a student at<br>中正中学(义顺)
          and a Cadet Officer (69th Batch) in the National Cadet Corps. In his free time James enjoys sketching and you can see his works decorating Engacad. But words can only describe a person so much.
          You can follow James here on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blasphemy_beyond_insanity/">Instagram</a> to find our more about him.</p>
